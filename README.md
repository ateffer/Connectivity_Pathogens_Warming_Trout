# Connectivity_Pathogens_Warming_Trout
This David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellowship project investigates the role of watershed connectivity, temperature, and pathogens on the resilience brook trout populations in Massachusetts.

Field samples were collected in August 2019 by electroshocking 3 stream systems (Roaring, Fourmile, West) in western MA for wild brook trout. Fish were placed independently in sterilized buckets filled with fresh stream water under biopsied nonlethally (gill, pelvic fin) or lethally (gill, fin, and internal tissues) then released if nonlethally sampled. All samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80C until processing for molecular analysis.
